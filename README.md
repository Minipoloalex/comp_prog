# Competitive programming
This repository contains solutions for several competitive programming problems, used as practice for competitions. It also contains notes about certain algorithms, based mostly on the book Competitive Programming 4 by Steven Halim, and on the [USACO guide](https://usaco.guide/). You can check my notes [here](notes/). The most explored themes are geometry and strings.

Currently, I have solved problems on the following online judges:
