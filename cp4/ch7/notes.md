## Chapter 7

### Rotating caliper and antipodal points
#### Antipodal points
These are the points diametrically opposite to each other (in furthest pair problem they are the farthest away from each other in the polygon)

## TODOs:
- kattis/roberthood - furthest pair problem and rotating caliper (might work with O(NÂ²) but objective is to learn the rotating caliper)
- kattis/biggest - biggest slice of pizza (probably specific case)
- kattis/ornaments - really easy, can't find formula for solution (in hand)
- kattis/convex_hull2 - probably an hard specific case
