## Chapter 7

## Cross-product

### 
$$ a\ \times\ b\ =\ (a_1i\ a_2j\ a_3k)\ \times\ (b_1i\ b_2j\ b_3k)$$
$$ =\ a1\ b1\ (i\ \times i)\ +\ \ a1\ b2\ (i\ \times\ j)\ +\ a1\ b3\ (i\ \times\ k) $$
$$\ +\ a2\ b1\ (j\ \times i)\ +\ a2\ b2\ (j\ \times\ j)\ +\ a2\ b3\ (j\ \times\ k) $$
$$+\ a3\ b1\ (k\ \times\ i)\ +\ a3\ b2\ (k\ \times\ j)\ +\ a3\ b3\ (k\ \times\ k)
$$

$$ i \times j = k$$
$$ j \times i = -k$$
$$ i \times k = -j$$
$$ k \times i = j$$
$$ j \times k = i$$
$$ k \times j = -i$$

## Rotating caliper and antipodal points
### Antipodal points
These are the points diametrically opposite to each other (in furthest pair problem they are the farthest away from each other in the polygon)

## TODOs:
- kattis/roberthood - furthest pair problem and rotating caliper (might work with O(NÂ²) but objective is to learn the rotating caliper)
- kattis/biggest - biggest slice of pizza (probably specific case)
- kattis/ornaments - really easy, can't find formula for solution (in hand)
- kattis/convex_hull2 - probably an hard specific case
