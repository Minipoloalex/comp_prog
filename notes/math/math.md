## Divisibility
1.  Largest multiple of $s$ that does not exceed $d$: $\lfloor \frac{d}{s}\rfloor * s$

2. A number is of the form $x^k$ iff the exponents on its prime divisors are all divisible by $k$.
For example:
$$64=2^6=(2^6)^1=(2^3)^2=(2^2)^3=(2^1)^6$$
The prime factor exponent (6) is divisible by $[1, 2, 3, 6]$, so it can be expressed as $x^k$, with $k \in [1, 2, 3, 6]$.
