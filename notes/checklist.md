## General Problem Solving Strategy
- Make sure you **understand the problem statement**, as well as the **test cases**.
- Try to **find some observations** about the problem.
    - You should **formulate any observations made and annotate them**. Even if they're not the main part of the problem, they might be useful for parts of it.
- **Formulate the solution and the implementation** before trying to implement anything.
    - If a solution is too complicated or elaborate, it's likely that there's some other way to solve the problem, likely with some additional observations.
