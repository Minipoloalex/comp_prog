## General Problem Solving Strategy
- Make sure you **understand the problem statement**, as well as the **test cases**.
- Try to **find some observations** about the problem.
    - You should **formulate any observations made and annotate them**. Even if they're not the main part of the problem, they might be useful for parts of it.
    - If it's an **easy problem**, (try to) **make a simple proof** for the observations to **avoid getting WA**.
    - You should also **experiment with more examples and different test cases**, to try to get a **counter-example for the observation**, depending on how sure you are. It can also be useful to detect other cases (not covered by the observation).
    - **Never just make an observation and assume it to be true**, always double-check it.
- **Formulate the solution and the implementation** before trying to implement anything.
    - If a solution is too complicated or elaborate, it's likely that there's some other way to solve the problem, likely with some additional observations.
- Depending on the number and variety of tests, **make more tests, to cover all the cases**.
- **Double check the code** through all of the steps after passing all the public test cases.
