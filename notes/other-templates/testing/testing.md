These are examples of 4 independent programs to setup testing a solution.
Based on the Errichto video on testing solutions.

The 4 programs, which can be made in any language, have the following responsibilities:
- Implemented solution (what we want to test)
- Brute force solution (correct solution, with no assumptions)
- Generates test cases (random, should take in a seed through command line arguments from the main testing script)
- Main testing scrit: asks generator for test cases and passes them to the corresponding programs
