# CSES
## Introductory
- Apple Division: classic **Minimum Subset Sum Difference** NP-hard problem. Brute force $\mathcal{O}(2^N)$


## Sorting and Searching
- Nearest Smaller Values: for each index, find nearest position to left having a smaller value - **Classic monotonic stack**
- Playlist: **two pointers** with set
- Subarray Distinct Values: **sliding window** on distinct values, with a map
- Maximum subarray sum 2: **sliding window on prefix sums** to find valid minimum for max subarray sum

## Graph Algorithms
- Counting Rooms: counting **connected components** - **DFS**
- Labyrinth: find **shortest path with unweighted edges** from start to end in a labyrinth and specify the path - **BFS**
- Building Roads: number of **connected components** and which edges to add to modify to only 1 CC - **DFS**
- Message Route: **shortest path with unweighted edges** between two nodes and specify the path - **BFS**
- Monsters: **shortest path with unweighted edges** from start to end in a labyrinth and specify the path. Also, avoid monsters - **BFS** from multiple sources

## Tree Algorithms
- Subtree queries: **Euler Tour technique**: PURQ for subtree values


## Additional Problems

### Sorting and Searching


### Graph Algorithms
- Graph Girth: **find shortest cycle length** in undirected unweighted graph - **BFS** for each node

### Stacks
- Advertisement: **find nearest smaller element to left and to right** for each position - **Monotonic stack both ways**
