## Comparing doubles
$$ |a âˆ’ b| < \epsilon$$


## Overflowing
To avoid overflow, using templates helps and testing with simple big polygons may also help.

## Area - Shoelace formula
Root at point $(0, 0)$ and calculate cross product of every pair of verticies: $2 * A = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (p_{i}\times p_{(i + 1) \% N})$.

### Result Sign
- If the signed area is positive, the vertices are ordered in a counterclockwise direction.
- If the signed area is negative, the vertices are ordered in a clockwise direction.

This is easy to understand if we think about two triangles from the algorithm: a "big" area and a "small" area. Then, we just simulate going through the triangles.

For example, if we go counterclockwise (CCW) overall, then CCW on big and CW on small. So, big counts POS and small counts NEG. This means resulting area will be positive.

- Big triangle/area: EBC

## Pick's Theorem and Polygon Lattice Points
$$ A = a + \frac{b}{2} - 1$$
$$ a = A - \frac{b}{2} + 1 = \frac{2*A - b}{2} + 1$$
where:
- $a$ is the number of integer points inside the polygon
- $b$ is the number of integer points on the boundary of the polygon


### How to calculate polygon lattice points?
Calculate the number of lattice points inside the polygon and on its boundary. A lattice point is a point whose coordinates are integers.

$b$ can be calculated using GCD of each segments X and Y length. For example:

Segment length (6, 2): GCD = 2, so there are 2 smaller segments with points on integer coordinates.



## Distances

### Maximum manhattan distance
$$(x', y') = (x + y, y - x)$$
$$|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| = max(|x'_1 - x'_2|, |y'_1 - y'_2|)$$

## Segment intersection

Check [cses/geometry/line_segment_intersection](../../cses/geometry/line_segment_intersection/intersection.cpp)


## Point in polygon
Ray casting approach, with vertical line slightly tilted to the right.

Check [cses/geometry/point_in_poly](../../cses/geometry/point_in_poly/point_in_poly.cpp)

In this image, we want to count an intersection for point D, not C (vertical line that goes from the point itself C/D to infinite positive y). This can be done simply by: $A.triangle(B, P) < 0$, with $A.x <= p.x < B.x$ (check the implementation).

On this image, point G is on the same X as P, but is considered to be at the left of the slightly tilted ray. Point H is considered to be on the right.

In this polygon, G is handled separately, E has one intersection (odd so inside) and F has two intersections (even so outside). In the point F case, the intersections are segment AB and segment CB. C is considered to be on the left and not on the right of the slightly tilted ray from point F.
