## General
- Collinear points
- Coincident points

## Segments
For example, in segment intersection.
- Parallel segments
- Collinear segments
- Intersection in one of the points
- Intersection between more than 2 segments

## Sweep Line
- Same and different types of events in same point

### Angular Sweep Line

- Entrance angle larger than the exit angle: we can handle it manually or by doubling the array to handle wrap-around

## Anti-podal points
- Edges with collinear points: likely should remove the collinear points
- Concave polygons: just make a convex polygon with CH
