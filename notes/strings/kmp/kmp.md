# KMP string matching/searching
Preprocesses the pattern and not the text, opposite of the suffix array.

Array/function $KMP[i]$ may also be called $\pi$ (pi) or prefix function.

$$
\pi_S[i] = \max\{\, k \mid S_{0..k-1} = S_{\,i-k+1..i} \,\}.
$$

## Code
Check [kmp.hpp](kmp.hpp).


### Interesting observations and ideas

- The value of the prefix function can only increase by at most once.
- For the construction $p + \# + t$, the value of the prefix function never exceeds $|p|$: $\forall i: pi[i] \le |p|$.


### Meaning of KMP array
For the prefix string that ends at position $i$, named $S[0:i]$: the KMP value is the longest suffix of that string coincides with a prefix of the string. And we don't want the full string (obviously).

This can also be called the border: check problem https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1732.

**"A border of a string is a prefix that is also a suffix of the string but not the whole string. For example, the borders of abcababcab are ab and abcab."**

In KMP, we usually want the biggest border for each prefix of the pattern. In this problem, we want all of the borders of the complete string:
```cpp
j = n;  // size
while (kmp[j] > 0) {
    cout << kmp[j] << " ";  // kmp[j] is border size
    j = kmp[j];
}
cout << '\n';
```

This code is easy to understand if we think of the example they gave.


### Preprocessing

Notes about the preprocessing - `kmpPreprocess`:
- The first iteration is always going to be setting the "first" position of the array $kmp[1] = 0$ and going to $l = 0$, $r = 1$.
- On the next iterations, if $l$ ever gets to $-1$, meaning that we have no match whatsoever, we are just going to set $kmp[r] = 0$.
    * If there isn't a match in characters $l$ and $r$, we want to go to the index which is the value in the table of the previous character. Since we are using 1-index, we can just do $l = kmp[l]$: index $l$ references character at index $l - 1$.


Can be confusing:

We want to go to that index because, even though we did not match that character, the previous was previously matched -> might be useful if we can match it (not the biggest match as we wanted, but a smaller thing that may or not match).

To better understand this, trace the code for the string `abacababc`, where `kmp = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 0]`

The values of the KMP array can be interpreted as follows:

### Search

The `kmpSearch` code is very similar to the previous and uses the same ideas.

Additional notes on the code:
- When finding a match, we act as if this was a mismatch on the new character (non-existing in the pattern) and continue looking for more matches. In fact, since we will be at indices incremented by 1 from the last matched character and are using 1-indexed for the $kmp$ array, we can directly reference $kmp[j]$. E.g.:
    - $t = abrabra$ (indexed by $i$)
    - $p = abra$ (indexed by $j$)
    - $kmp = [-1, 0, 0, 0, 1]$
    - $i = 4$, $j = 4$, $j = kmp[4] = 1$, now analyzing $p[1] = $ 'b' and $t[i] = t[4]$

- After finding a match, $i - j$ gives the index with the first character corresponding to the matching. The size of the match is simply $j$ or $m$ (the size of the pattern). E.g.:
    - $t = abrabra$ (indexed by $i$)
    - $p = abra$ (indexed by $j$)
        - When we find the first match, we will have $i = 4$ and $j = 4$. The starting index is $i - j = 0$ and the size of the match is $m = j = 4$.
        - When we find the second match, we will have $i = 7$ and $j = 4$. The starting index is $i - j = 3$.

Note how $i$ corresponds to the index after the final character matched (it is exclusive). If it was inclusive, then we would have to add one: $i - j + 1$. $i - j$ is used because $i$ is exclusive and $j$ is the size.

## Code (Old Version)
Complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ ($M < N$, $N$ size of text, $M$ size of pattern).

Check [kmp.hpp](kmp.hpp). Note that the code below is a tested implementation of KMP, but is slightly outdated (I prefer using classes and not global variables).

```cpp
// A border of a string is a prefix that is also a suffix of the string (but not the whole string). For example, the borders of "abcababcab" and "ab" and "abcab".
// KMP[i + 1]: contains the length of the longest border of the prefix of P that ends at i
// Example: "abacababc": kmp = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 0]

// Don't confuse the prefix from the border definition with this other prefix.
// Here, the prefix that ends at i takes the role of the whole string in the border definition.

// Pattern preprocessed (back jumps): [-1, 0, ...]
vector<int> kmp;

void kmpPreprocess(const string &p) { // pattern p
    int sz = int(p.size());
    kmp.resize(sz + 1);

    int l = -1, r = 0;
    kmp[0] = -1;
    while (r < sz) {    // l < r
        while (l >= 0 && p[r] != p[l]) l = kmp[l];
        l++; r++;

        // Here, we have l >= 0 and r >= 1
        // Comparison of the i'th character corresponds to
        // the (i + 1)'th position in the array
        kmp[r] = l;
    }
}

// pattern p, text t (must call kmpPreprocess(p) before)
void kmpSearch(const string &p, const string &t) {
    int n = int(t.size());
    int m = int(p.size());
    int i = 0, j = 0;   // i loops through text, j through pattern
    while (i < n) {
        while (j >= 0 && (t[i] != p[j])) j = kmp[j];
        i++; j++;
        if (j == m) {
            cout << "Match found starting at index " << i - j << '\n';
            j = kmp[j];  // continue looking for more matches 
        }
    }
}
```

### Pattern matching additional option
```cpp
string together = p + '#' + t;
kmpPreprocess(together);
for (int i = 0; i < int(kmp.size()); i++) {
    if (kmp[i] == int(p.size())) {
        cout << "Match found at index " << i - int(p.size()) << " of together\n";
        cout << "Match found at index " << i - 2 * int(p.size()) - 1 << " of text\n";
        // -1 accounts for the delimiter
        // kmp[i + 1] -> corresponds to index i of the string
        // i - p.size() -> gives starting index of match (i corresponds to S[i - 1])
    }
}
```

To better understand it, you can write the together string for the example at https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1753/.

In this configuration, $\forall i: kmp[i] \le |p|$.

## Problems
Simplest:
1. String Matching: https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1753/
2. Finding borders: https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1732/

Harder:

3. A version of **Counting the number of occurrences of each prefix** of a string: https://codeforces.com/contest/432/problem/D: Builds on 2, idea of representing KMP as a tree. Check https://cp-algorithms.com/string/prefix-function.html#counting-the-number-of-occurrences-of-each-prefix.
4. DP based on KMP to maximize substring occurrence: https://codeforces.com/contest/808/problem/G: good problem with cool optimization based on the **prefix function automaton**: https://cp-algorithms.com/string/prefix-function.html#building-an-automaton-according-to-the-prefix-function. Note how the automaton allows preprocessing, without even having the actual text.
5. The number of different substrings in a string (allowing insertions at the end and beginning and deletions) but in $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$: https://cp-algorithms.com/string/prefix-function.html#the-number-of-different-substring-in-a-string.
6. Compressing a string (similar to periods, but more "precise"): the shortest "compressed" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$â€Šof smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$. https://cp-algorithms.com/string/prefix-function.html#compressing-a-string.
